##Proliferation Analysis
The proliferation analysis method is as follows:  
First, the cells within each well are auto-gated into Edu+  
The proportion of EdU+ cells at each spot is calculated  
The proportions are logit transformed then RUV and loess normalized  
The normalized proportions are then summarized by the medians of their replicates.
